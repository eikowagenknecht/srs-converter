A TypeScript library for converting between different spaced repetition system (SRS) formats.

**Goal**: Enable seamless data migration between popular SRS applications like Anki, Mnemosyne, SuperMemo, and Mochi, preserving as much data as possible.

> [!warning]
> **Alpha Software**: This library is in early alpha development.
> APIs may change without notice, and data loss could occur.
>
> **This is not recommended for production use yet.**
> Please backup your data before testing.

## Features

- **Anki Support**: Convert `.apkg` and `.colpkg` packages to a universal SRS format
- **Complete Data**: Support for notes, cards, decks, and review history
- **Node.js Only**: Currently requires Node.js (browser support planned for future releases)
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation and tri-state error reporting
- **Well-Tested Dependencies**: Uses established libraries for SQLite parsing, archive handling, and data processing
- **Extensible**: Architecture designed to support additional SRS formats in the future

### Universal SRS Format

The library aims to define a universal SRS format.
This is neccessary, because the current SRS formats are very fragmented and undocumented.
As a strong opponent of vendor lock-in, the library will strive to create a format that:

- Is open and accessible
- Is human-readable
- Has support for all the relevant entities of SRS systems (notes, cards, decks, etc.)
- Is well-documented (we will provide comprehensive RFC style documentation)
- Uses normalized data structures
- Is free from proprietary constraints
- Guarantees upward compatibility
- Is easily extensible for additional application specific data

## Installation

Install from npm:

```bash
npm install srs-converter
pnpm install srs-converter
yarn add srs-converter
```

### Development Installation

For development or testing, you can also install this package locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eikowagenknecht/srs-converter.git
cd srs-converter

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the package
pnpm build
```

## Platform Compatibility

- **Node.js**: Full support (v22+ recommended)
- **Bun** / **Deno**: Not tested
- **Browser**: Not currently supported (uses Node.js-specific filesystem APIs)

**Note**: Browser support is planned for future releases by abstracting file system operations.

## Usage

For comprehensive usage examples and API documentation, see the [Usage Guide](docs/README.usage.md).

## Project Status

The library development follows a phase-based approach. For detailed development progress, upcoming features, and implementation status, see the [**Development Stories**](docs/stories/README.md).

**Current Focus**: We're in early development, expanding test coverage for existing Anki functionality and adding support for media files and complex note types (Cloze, Image Occlusion) before implementing additional SRS formats (Mnemosyne, Mochi, SuperMemo).

### Format Support Matrix

| Feature | Anki | Mnemosyne | SuperMemo | Mochi | Custom Formats |
|---------|------|-----------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Read Support** | ✅ Good | ❌ Planned | ❌ Planned | ❌ Planned | ❌ Planned |
| **Write Support** | ✅ Good | ❌ Planned | ❌ Planned | ❌ Planned | ❌ Planned |
| **Round-trip** | ✅ Working | ❌ Planned | ❌ Planned | ❌ Planned | ❌ Planned |
| **File Types** | `.apkg`, `.colpkg` | - | - | - | - |
| **Database Schema** | Legacy v2 | - | - | - | - |

### Anki Format Details

For detailed technical information about the Anki package format, see: [Understanding the Anki .apkg Format (Legacy 2)](https://eikowagenknecht.de/posts/understanding-the-anki-apkg-format-legacy-2/)

| Component | Support Level | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Decks** | ✅ Full | Name, description, configuration, hierarchy |
| **Note Types** | ✅ Full | Fields, templates, CSS styling, configuration |
| **Notes** | ✅ Full | Content in all fields, tags, modification timestamps |
| **Cards** | ✅ Full | Question/answer templates, due dates, intervals, ease factors |
| **Review History** | ✅ Full | Complete review logs with timestamps and scores |
| **Media Files** | ⚠️ Partial | Internal preservation of the mappings only - no user-facing API for retrieving or adding actual files |
| **Formats** | ⚠️ Partial | Only Legacy v2 is supported for now |
| **Plugin Data** | ❌ No | Plugin-specific data may be ignored |
| **Conversion Quality** | ⚠️ Partial | Anki ↔ Universal SRS format conversion preserves basic data with round-trip capability |
| **Advanced Features** | ⚠️ Partial | Complex note types (Cloze, Image Occlusion) are untested |
