# Development Commands

## Package Development

- `pnpm dev` - Start TypeScript compiler in watch mode
- `pnpm build` - Build the TypeScript package for production

## Package Management

- Uses `pnpm` as the package manager (**NEVER** use npm or yarn commands as this may confuse pnpm)
- Lock file: `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- Dependencies are pinned and updated via dependabot usually
- Use `pnpm dlx` for one-off package executions
- Run `pnpm install` for initial setup or after dependency changes

## Testing and Quality

- `pnpm test` - Run tests with Vitest
- `pnpm test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
- `pnpm lint` - Full lint and fix run (type-check + eslint + prettier + biome)
- `pnpm lint:biome` - Run biome linter (fast, catches most issues)
- `pnpm type-check` - TypeScript type checking only
- `pnpm format` - Format code with prettier and biome

### Additional Development Tools

- `pnpm sync:npm` - Update npm dependencies after dependabot updates
- `pnpm clean:npm` - Clean node_modules
- `pnpm upgrade:npm` - Upgrade local npm dependencies and package-lock.json file
- `pnpm outdated` - Show outdated npm dependencies
