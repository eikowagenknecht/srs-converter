## Overview

This document outlines the current development roadmap for the srs-converter library, from completing format-specific I/O implementations through universal format design and cross-format conversion capabilities.

- ‚úÖ Completed - Implemented and verified
- üß™ Testing - Implementation complete, awaiting verification

## Phase Progress & Success Criteria

### [Phase 1: Anki Format I/O](phase-1.md)

Complete Anki reading and writing implementation with all features and edge cases.

- **Phase 1.0**: Anki Reading (.apkg/.colpkg)
  - Progress: 4/6 stories completed (67%) üîÑ
  - Status: Anki reading mostly works, with all major note types supported. Still need schema version support and corrupted file handling.

- **Phase 1.1**: Anki Writing (.apkg/.colpkg) + Media File APIs
  - Progress: 4/8 stories completed (50%) üîÑ
  - Status: Core writing implementation complete. Still need: plugin data documentation, and user-facing media file APIs (retrieve, add, manage)

- **Phase 1.2**: Anki Testing and Edge Cases
  - Progress: 2/5 stories completed (40%) üîÑ
  - Status: Round-trip tests and ID preservation complete, need comprehensive coverage

## Development Notes

### Library Design Principles

- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between format-specific I/O and universal conversion
- **Format Fidelity**: Preserve all format-specific features and data
- **Error Handling**: Use tri-state error pattern for robust error reporting
- **Performance**: Efficient handling of large datasets
- **Extensibility**: Design for easy addition of new formats

### Story Guidelines

- Stories may have dependencies but should be independently testable
- Each story includes comprehensive acceptance criteria
- Complex features are broken down across multiple stories

### Testing Strategy

- **Format I/O Stories**: Unit testing with real SRS files + round-trip testing
- **Conversion Stories**: Cross-format testing + data integrity validation
- **Performance Stories**: Benchmark testing with large datasets
- **Integration Stories**: End-to-end testing with actual SRS applications
