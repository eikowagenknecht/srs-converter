# Known Issues & Bugs

This file tracks bugs and technical issues discovered during development that need to be resolved later.
We're keeping this as a simple living markdown document for now.
When the project matures, we may switch to a more formal issue tracking system like GitHub Issues.

## Usage

When you discover a bug or technical issue during development, add it to the "Current Issues" section below using the format from the "Format Example".
When the issue is resolved, remove it from the "Current Issues" section again.

## Format Example

```markdown
### (YYYY-MM-DD) Issue Title (Priority: High/Medium/Low)

**Problem:** Clear description of the issue
**Steps to reproduce:** (if applicable)
**Impact:** Description of impact
**Notes:** Additional context or dependencies
```
