# Usage Guide

This documentation explains how to use the srs-converter library for working with SRS (Spaced Repetition System) data.

It's split into four main sections:

- **[Reading SRS Data](reading/README.md)** - Import existing SRS packages
- **[Converting Between Formats](converting/README.md)** - Convert data between different SRS formats
- **[Creating SRS Data](creating/README.md)** - Create new SRS packages from scratch (in various formats)
- **[Exporting SRS Data](exporting/README.md)** - Export your created packages to a file (in various formats)

## Examples Repository Structure

All documentation includes working code examples that are tested in the repository to prevent regressions (in `*.test.ts` files).
But if you find that an example is not working as expected, please open an issue so we can fix it.
