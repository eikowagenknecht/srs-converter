# Exporting to Anki Format

Once you either [created](../../creating/anki/README.md) or [converted into](../../converting/srs-to-anki.md) your Anki content, you can export it to .apkg files that can be used by Anki.

## Basic Export Example

```typescript
// Assume ankiPackage is already loaded (see Reading Guide)
const exportPath = "./my-custom-deck.apkg";
await ankiPackage.toAnkiExport(exportPath);
console.log(`âœ… Created Anki package: ${exportPath}`);
```

> ðŸ“‹ **Test:** This example is tested in [`anki/README.test.ts`](README.test.ts) - "should export an Anki package to file"

That's it. You can now import the file into your Anki application.
