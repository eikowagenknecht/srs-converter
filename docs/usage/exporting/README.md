# Exporting SRS Data

Once you've either imported (see [Reading Guide](../reading/README.md)) or created (see [Creating Guide](../creating/README.md)) some SRS data, you can export it to various formats for use in different spaced repetition systems.

Data needs to be in the application specific format for each SRS system before it can be exported. For conversion to the specific format, see the [Converting Guide](../converting/README.md).

## Supported Formats

srs-converter currently supports exporting to the following formats:
