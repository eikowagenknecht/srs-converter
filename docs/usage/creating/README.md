# Creating SRS Data

If you want to create new SRS data from scratch, there are several approaches you can take.

This guide covers creating new SRS packages from scratch using srs-converter for different spaced repetition systems.

Once you have created the data, you can either [convert](../converting/README.md) it to another supported format or [export](../exporting/README.md) it into a file.

## Supported Formats

srs-converter currently supports creating data for the following SRS formats:
