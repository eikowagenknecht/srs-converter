# Design SRS Converter as Standalone npm Package

## Context and Problem Statement

The SRS converter functionality for importing/exporting Anki packages and other spaced repetition formats is a valuable utility that could benefit other projects in the spaced repetition ecosystem.
We need to decide whether to design this as a focused, standalone library or as part of a larger application codebase.

## Decision Outcome

We will design the SRS converter as a completely self-contained, standalone npm package.
The package will have no external dependencies beyond its declared npm dependencies and will be usable independently by any TypeScript/JavaScript project.

### Consequences

- Good, because enables code reuse across the spaced repetition software ecosystem.
- Good, because forces clean architectural separation and better API design.
- Good, because prevents duplication of Anki import/export logic in other projects.
- Good, because encourages higher code quality through external scrutiny.
- Good, because enables community contributions and improvements.
- Neutral, because requires maintaining API stability and backward compatibility.
- Neutral, because increases documentation requirements for external users.
- Bad, because adds versioning complexity and release management overhead.
- Bad, because creates external dependencies that must be maintained long-term.
- Bad, because requires supporting diverse use cases beyond original requirements.
