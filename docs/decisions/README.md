# Decisions

For new Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), please use the following template as a starting point: [adr-template.md](adr-template.md). It has a lot of sections, but most are optional and should only be used if they add value for this specific MADR!

If you are not sure which to use, go with the default:

- Short title, representative of solved problem and found solution
- Context and Problem Statement
- Considered Options
- Decision Outcome
- Consequences

Only add the other sections if it really is needed.

The MADR documentation is available at <https://adr.github.io/madr/> while general information about ADRs is available at <https://adr.github.io/>.
