## Getting Started

**First-time setup:** See [docs/README.setup.md](docs/README.setup.md) for detailed environment setup instructions.

## Development Workflow

1. **Open an issue first** - For larger changes, make sure to describe what you'd like to work on so we can discuss if it fits into the project.
2. **Fork and implement** - Create your changes following the existing code style, make sure `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` pass.
3. **Submit a PR** - Reference the issue in your pull request.

This prevents duplicate work and ensures your contribution fits the project direction.
